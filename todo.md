Based on the console logs and the screenshot, the async/await error in 
Game.tsx
 persists. The server is failing to compile the code, which is causing the 404 and 500 errors you're seeing in the browser.

Here is a prompt for the next agent to continue with the fix:

Prompt for the next agent:

The 3D FPS game is failing to compile due to an async/await syntax error in 
components/Game.tsx
. The error is: "await" can only be used inside an "async" function.

The error occurs on line 328, where await loadModel(...) is called inside an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that is not marked as async.

Task:

Read the contents of 
c:\Users\prest\Desktop\Desktop_Projects\May-Dec-2025\Pefect dark\components\Game.tsx
.
Locate the IIFE that wraps the await loadModel(...) call for bot creation.
Modify the IIFE to be async. The change will likely be from 
(() => {
 to 
(async () => {
.
After applying the fix, the development server should restart automatically. Verify that the compilation error is gone.
If the error is resolved, instruct the user to test the game in the browser to confirm that the bot models load correctly and all gameplay features are functional.
